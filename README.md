## How to use

Download the most recent release on the right or manually run the python file


## Compatibility

Ive restricted it to Windows only just to avoid any issues, you can remove the restriction by deleting lines `6`-`8`


## Known Issues

- The library being used only allows for relatively small downloads at one time ( Just try again after a little bit )
- Doesnt scale to different resolutions at all
